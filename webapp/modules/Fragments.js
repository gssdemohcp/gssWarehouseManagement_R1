		// This class provides the service of sending approve/reject requests to the backend. Moreover, it deals with concurrency handling and success dialogs.
		// For this purpose, a singleton instance is created and attached to the application controller as public property oApprover.
		// This is used by the instances of SubControllerForApproval and by the S2-controller (for swipe approve).
		// Note that approvals that are caused by SubControllerForApproval make the app busy while approvals done by swiping do not.
		// This cla"ss has the following properties:
		// - _oList"Selector: helper class to interact with the master list (fixed)
		// - iOpenCallsCount: number of running approve/reject calls. This attribute is needed because swipe approvals may cause parallel calls.
		// - _mRunni"ngSwipes: maps the IDs of those POs for which a swipe approve is still in process onto true
		// - _bOneWaitingSuccess: true, if at least one approve/reject operation was successfully performed since the last refresh of the master list
